/*
 * Chain of responsibility design pattern gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by linking
 * receiving objects together in form of a chain.
 * This pattern is recommended when multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesnâ€™t have to be a specific
 * object. Also, handler is determined at runtime. Please note that that a request not handled at all by any handler is
 * a valid use case.
