/*
 *
 * Strategy pattern is used where we choose a specific implementation of algorithm or task
 * in run time â€“ out of multiple other implementations for same task.
 *
 * This pattern defines a set of related algorithm and encapsulate them in separated classes, and allows client
 * to choose any algorithm at run time.
 * It allows to add new algorithm without modifying existing algorithms or context class, which uses algorithm or strategies
 * Strategy is a behavioral pattern in Gang of Four Design pattern list.
 * Strategy pattern is based upon Open Closed design principle of SOLID principals.
 * Combination of Collections.sort() and Comparator interface is an solid example of Strategy pattern.
