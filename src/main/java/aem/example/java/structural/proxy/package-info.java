/*
 * In proxy design pattern, a proxy object provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
 * Proxy is heavily used to implement lazy loading related usecases where we do not want to create full object until
 * it is actually needed.
 * Proxies focus on controlling the access to an object.
