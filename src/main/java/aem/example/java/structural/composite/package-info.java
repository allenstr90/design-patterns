/*
 * Composite design pattern helps to compose the objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.
 * Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
 *
 * The composite pattern defines class hierarchies consisting of individual objects and composite objects.
 * Clients treat primitive and composite objects uniformly through a component interface which makes client code simple.
 * Adding new components can be easy and client code does not need to be changed since client deals with the new components through the component interface.
 * Composite hierarchy can be traversed with Iterator design pattern.
 * Visitor design pattern can apply an operation over a Composite.
 * Flyweight design pattern is often combined with Composite to implement shared leaf nodes.
