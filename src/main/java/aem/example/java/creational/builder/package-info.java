/**
 * Builder design pattern is an alternative way to construct complex objects and should be used only when
 * we want to build different types of immutable objects using same object building process.
 *
 * The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using
 * the correct sequence of actions. The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know
 * the type of object it is to create.
